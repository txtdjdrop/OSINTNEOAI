Build an autonomous, full-cycle OSINT evidence ingestion, neural OCR entity extraction, BigQuery graph correlation, and investigative dossier generation pipeline for OsintNeoAi.

Working directory: C:\OsintNeoAi
Integrity mode: development

## Requirements

### R1. Multi-Format Evidence Ingestion & Neural OCR Processing
The pipeline must automatically scan, ingest, and unpack raw multi-format evidence (PDF medical/court records, images, Google Drive/Photos exports, zip archives in evidence/ or incoming queues), extract machine-readable text and metadata, and store structured audit-ready JSON artifacts with SHA-256 integrity hashes.

### R2. Entity Extraction, Cross-Referencing & Graph Analysis
Extracted records must be processed through an entity resolution engine to extract named entities (organizations, individuals, government agencies, medical identifiers, case numbers, addresses, financial amounts) and format them for BigQuery graph tables (national_audits, onedrive_forensics, forensic_layers).

### R3. Automated Dossier, Timeline & Correlation Matrix Generation
The system must generate daily intelligence briefing summaries, chronological event timelines, and cross-entity correlation matrices saved to reports/daily/ and formatted in Markdown and tabular JSON for interactive dashboard consumption.

### R4. Automated Verification & 3-Location Backup Protocol
The pipeline must include a self-verifying test suite that programmatically validates ingestion, OCR extraction accuracy, graph schema compliance, and report generation, automatically executing the mandatory 3-location backup protocol (GitHub main, Local PC backups/repo/, and Google Drive Sharedall/OsintNeoAi/).

## Acceptance Criteria

### Ingestion & OCR
- [ ] Pipeline discovers and processes incoming documents in evidence/ without unhandled crashes.
- [ ] Generates SHA-256 content hashes and normalized metadata for all ingested artifacts.

### Entity & Graph Extraction
- [ ] Extracts structured entities (people, organizations, locations, identifiers, dates) into clean JSON schema.
- [ ] Produces records compatible with BigQuery graph and table schemas.

### Reporting & Verification
- [ ] Programmatic verification test suite runs and passes cleanly (python test_pipeline.py or equivalent).
- [ ] Generates at least one comprehensive forensic intelligence dossier in reports/daily/.
- [ ] Confirms successful backup sync across GitHub, Local PC, and Google Drive Sharedall.

Autonomous verification, execution, and continuous synchronization of the OsintNeoAi repository, citizen intelligence framework, Genesis Ingestion API, and interactive workspace HUD.

Working directory: C:\OsintNeoAi
Integrity mode: development

## Requirements

### R1. Genesis Ingestion & Verification Engine
- Verify and execute the FastAPI backend (`api/main.py`) containing the `/api/genesis/ingest` zero-trust SHA-256 point-of-upload hashing route.
- Validate dynamic auto-routing between Biographical Dossier and Corporate Wiki Dossier based on input keywords.
- Ensure automated attribution of victim status and statutory tag injection (CA Civil Code § 1946.2, AB 1482, CERCLA Superfund).

### R2. Workspace HUD & Interactive Graph Testing
- Verify `workspace_v2.html` loads the acrylic theme interface, Cytoscape.js relationship graph, toxic plume intercept banner, and franchise data demand module.
- Provide automated end-to-end testing of chat input submission and responsive graph rendering.

### R3. Dual-Repository Synchronization & Backup
- Ensure all created assets, data files, markdown registries, and code changes are committed and synced across Git (`origin/main`) and designated cloud storage mirrors (`rclone` to `gdrive:Sharedall/OsintNeoAi/`).

## Acceptance Criteria

### Automated Backend Tests
- [ ] `api/main.py` launches cleanly and responds to `POST /api/genesis/ingest` with valid status 200 JSON including SHA-256 hash.
- [ ] Bio vs. Corporate classification test cases pass with deterministic categorization.

### Frontend HUD Verification
- [ ] `workspace_v2.html` renders all 7 theme styles without JS console errors.
- [ ] Cytoscape link graph properly creates victim-to-contaminant node links on sample payloads.

### Repository Status
- [ ] Git working tree clean or fully committed on `main`.
- [ ] Mirror sync status verified.

# Teamwork Project Prompt

Build and enhance the OsintNeoAi master intelligence platform with automated OCGIS spatial permit scraping, APN spatial cluster mapping, and multi-vector OSINT data ingestion for target locations.

Working directory: C:\Users\Amd949609\StudioProjects\OsintNeoAi
Integrity mode: development

## Requirements

### R1. OCGIS Spatial Permit & Land Insights Scraper
Automate Playwright headless browser navigation to `https://webapps.ocgis.com/oclandinsights/home/`, dynamically fill access registration fields, enable submit buttons, query spatial boundaries, and capture map screenshots for target locations (0.25m radius around target addresses).

### R2. APN Cluster Data Structuring & Persistence
Extract parcel popups, historical permits, and APN cluster records, parsing the raw results into structured JSON files under `data/` and saving rendering screenshots under `scratch/`.

### R3. Automated Git Backup & Integrity State Preservation

## Acceptance Criteria

### Execution & Verification
- [ ] OCGIS Playwright scraper completes navigation and captures valid map rendering screenshots to `scratch/`.
- [ ] Historical APN cluster dataset is successfully dumped to `data/ocgis_historical_apn_data.json`.
- [ ] All code changes and dataset artifacts pass clean `git commit` and `git push origin main` without secret protection violations.
