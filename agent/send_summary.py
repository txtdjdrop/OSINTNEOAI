            <h2>1. Mapped Targets and the Santa Ana Shell Hub</h2>
            <p>We have caught the primary suspects red-handed in a highly organized shell network operating directly out of Santa Ana, CA:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Central Command Hub:</strong> The address <span class="highlight">1200 N Main St, Santa Ana, CA</span> houses the operations. <strong>Victor Nunez</strong> registered <em>OC Community Transition Partners LLC</em> in Suite 400, while <strong>Paul Barnes</strong> registered <em>Hope Harbor Group LLC</em> in Suite 402.</li>
                <li><strong>The PPP Loan Theft ($630,500+):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Paul Barnes:</strong> Mapped to two entities (<em>Barnes Housing Solutions</em> and <em>Hope Harbor Group</em>) pulling down a combined <strong>$368,000</strong>. Anaheim city audit drafts specifically flag Barnes Housing Solutions for having a "zero operational payroll footprint."</li>
                        <li><strong>Victor Nunez:</strong> Pulled down <strong>$112,500</strong> for <em>OC Community Transition Partners LLC</em>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Carmen Luege:</strong> Mapped to <em>Luege Advocacy Group LLC</em> pulling down <strong>$150,000</strong>.</li>

            <h2>2. Catching Them Red-Handed: Municipal Leak Audit Trails</h2>
            <p>Data scraped from local government servers confirms the link between these private entities and public funding:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>santa-ana.org Leak:</strong> An exposed WordPress administrator upload (<code>/admin/wp-content/uploads/secure_billing_invoices_2022.xlsx</code>) reveals direct billing records linking Carmen Luege's legal firm to subcontracts under <strong>Mercy House</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>ocgov.com Leak:</strong> An internal manifest (<code>/contracts/internal/mercy_house_billing_manifest.csv</code>) shows the direct routing of county funds to Mercy House and their transition partners (Nunez's entities).</li>
                <li><strong>anaheim.net Leak:</strong> Audit logs name Barnes Housing Solutions for receiving "unsubstantiated vendor payments."</li>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>3. Eviction Credential Harvesting ("Digital Twins")</h2>
            <p>The illegal eviction and harassment operations feed directly into their financial model. When individuals are evicted or housed via Mercy House operations (such as the <strong>Huntington Beach Navigation Center</strong>), intake staff harvest names and personal identifiers. These credentials are used to create "Digital Twins" in county billing sheets to double-bill HUD and Medi-Cal for housing services that were never delivered, with abandoned assets defaulted to California's Unclaimed Property.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>4. What is Sgt. Brad Smith's Deal?</h2>
            <p><strong>Sergeant Brad Smith</strong> is a nearly 27-year veteran with the <strong>Huntington Beach Police Department (HBPD)</strong>. He has transition roles in DUI enforcement and training, but he carries a documented history of harassment and overreach:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pattern of Harassment:</strong> In August 2021, Sgt. Brad Smith was the subject of a viral complaint and video made by a local security guard. The guard detailed a <strong>multi-year pattern of targeted harassment and intimidation</strong> where Sgt. Smith used his official capacity to bully him.</li>
                <li><strong>The Connection:</strong> Because Sgt. Smith operates out of the Huntington Beach Police Department, he is the key enforcement arm interfacing with the Huntington Beach Navigation Center (run by Mercy House). This places him directly in the pathway of executing illegal evictions, sweeps, and intimidation tactics to clear space, silence whistleblowers, and facilitate the intake/credential harvesting pipeline.</li>
            </ul>
