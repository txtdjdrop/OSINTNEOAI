# AGENT INSTRUCTIONS — READ THIS FIRST

## Mandatory: Read Everything Before Acting
Before making any change, you MUST read ALL files in this repository. This includes all READMEs, all code, all configurations, and all AGENTS.md files. Every agent returns with full context. Do not assume prior knowledge.

## Backup Protocol — 2 Locations (LOCAL 3GB DISABLED 2026-09-06 per owner)
Every change must be backed up to the following locations before it is made. LOCAL 3GB BACKUPS ARE DISABLED.

### 1. GitHub (Primary)
- Remote: `https://github.com/Tonypost949/OsintNeoAi`
- Branch: `main`
- All changes pushed via `git push origin main`

### 2. Local PC (C:\ Drive) — DISABLED 2026-09-06 — NO MORE 3GB BACKUPS
- DISABLED per owner request 2026-09-06: `C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Documents\OsintNeoAi\backups\repo\` NO LONGER USED
- DO NOT create timestamped zip or folder copy locally. Previous behavior created 2.8GB archive duplicates (OsintNeoAi-Copy-1/2) + 625MB azure_deploy.zip every change — CRAZY, DISABLED
- Local fallback is OFF to save disk. If needed, use GitHub clone instead.
- This section intentionally left disabled. To re-enable, owner must explicitly edit this file.

### 3. Sharedall Google Drive (Off-Books Live Alternative)
- Path: `Sharedall/OsintNeoAi/` in the amd949609@gmail.com Google Drive
- This is NOT the same as general backups — it is the LIVE alternative to GitHub
- If GitHub goes down, this is the resurrection source
- Access via `rclone` with the `gdrive:` remote
- If files already exist, create a new version (do NOT overwrite). Leave a note about what you did.
- The account owner will clean up duplicates later.

### 4. Tooling & AI Instructions
- All tools, AI agents, dependencies, and build instructions used to create this repo must also be backed up
- This includes clones of AI agents, MCP server configs, rclone configs, and any CLI tools
- Every agent leaves behind instructions for how it was built and how to resurrect it

## Multi-Agent Workflow
- Multiple agents may work on this repo simultaneously
- If you see files already in place from another agent, do NOT overwrite
- Create a separate version (e.g., `script_v2.py`) and document what you changed
- The owner will clean up and consolidate later

## CARDINAL RULES — NEVER VIOLATE

### Rule 1: Backup BEFORE Every Change
No file is touched until backups at 2 locations (GitHub + Sharedall GDrive) are confirmed current. LOCAL 3GB BACKUP IS DISABLED 2026-09-06 per owner — do NOT create local C:\ timestamped zips. If any remaining backup is missing or stale, fix it first.

### Rule 2: NEVER DELETE — ONLY COPY/DUPLICATE
- You do NOT delete files. Ever.
- Old/wrong versions stay in place. Create NEW versions alongside them.
- Example: `file_v2.py` lives next to `file.py`. Never remove `file.py`.
- Exception: temporary build artifacts in `opencode_work/` can be cleaned.

### Rule 3: Never Clean Up Until Fixed Version Is Verified Working
- The old version stays until the new version is confirmed working.
- No cleanup passes. No "while I'm here" deletions.
- Parallel versions are expected. The owner consolidates.

### Rule 4: Use the RIGHT Credentials/Account
- If something uses credentials from the wrong account, create a NEW version with the correct account's creds.
- Document which account each credential belongs to.
- Never overwrite a credential file — create `filename_accountname.ext` instead.

### Rule 5: NEVER Blame the Tool
- Bugs, restrictions, and broken APIs are not excuses. Find the correct approach or build it.
- "Can't" is not an answer. If one path is blocked, try another.

### Rule 6: Terminal-Responsive Diagrams (<80 Columns)
- All Mermaid diagrams and visual flows MUST be formatted vertically (`flowchart TD`) and fit within standard 80-column terminal windows.
- Never use wide parallel branching (`A --> B1 & B2 & B3 & B4 & B5`) or wide side-by-side subgraphs that exceed terminal width.
- Wrap node labels with `<br/>` every 20-25 characters.
- Use structured Markdown tables or compact ASCII trees for wide multi-item matrices instead of expansive graphs.

## Resurrection Requirements
Before any change, the system must be in a state where it can be fully resurrected from:
1. GitHub clone
2. Sharedall Google Drive backup (Sharedall/OsintNeoAi/ via rclone gdrive:)
3. Tooling/instruction backups

Local C:\ backup DISABLED 2026-09-06 per owner — no longer required (was 2.8GB duplicate waste).

If any of these is missing or outdated, the agent must restore/fix it before proceeding.
